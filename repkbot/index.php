		<h2>RepkBot - A simple Twitch.TV Chat Bot</h2>
		</br>
		<p>RepkBot is a simple, open source, irc bot written in node.js intended to provide some useful features to Twitch.TV chat channels.</p>
		
		<p>The bot has several commands that allow it to do things like keep track of
			death counts, print quotes, print various 'told' and 'rekt' messages, as 
			well as broadcast news/announcements at specified time intervals.</p>
			
		<p>Some commands are restricted to 'trusted' users only. These users can be added
			to the 'trusted' list via the !trust command. The owner of a Twitch channel is
			always a 'trusted' user for that channel and can therefore add additional trusted
			users who can control the bot in their channel.</p>
			
		<p>Source code for this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/repkam09/repbot-irc">GitHub here</a>.</p>

		<p>Documentation of currently existing commands can be found in the <a href="hhttps://github.com/repkam09/repbot-irc/blob/master/README.md">readme here</a>.</p>
		
		<p>If you want to take a look at the basic bot features, you can type any of the bot commands in my <a href="http://twitch.tv/repkam09/chat/">twitch.tv chat page</a>.</p>
