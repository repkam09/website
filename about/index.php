		<h2>Greetings! I'm Mark.</h2>
		</br>
		<p>I am a 24 year old Computer Science student working as a Software Engineer. I am working on a degree in Computer Science from RIT. I enjoy <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/repkam09">music</a>, cooking, programming, and playing video games - mostly Minecraft and RuneScape.</p>
		
		<p>I do enjoy programming and scripting in my free time and have been trying to get better at actually posting the things that I make on Github. If you want to take a look, you can find that <a href="https://github.com/repkam09">here</a>. If you are looking for information about my other programming or work experience you can view my resume <a href="/files/resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>

		<p>Other things about me, I played piano for over 13 years, I ran Track and Cross Country for 6 years, and my favorite TV show is Top Gear (followed closely by Doctor Who and Sherlock...)</p>

		<p>This server is hosted by <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>, who I highly recommend if you are looking for a Virtual Private Server!</p>
