	<h2>Greetings! I'm Mark.</h2>
	</br>
	<p>I am a 22 year old Computer Science student working as a Software Engineer. I am working on a degree in Computer Science from RIT. I enjoy <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/repkam09">music</a>, cooking, programming, and playing video games - mostly Minecraft. This website acts as my personal page as well as the main site for my Minecraft Server, with quite a few game server related services.</p>

	<p>I do enjoy programming and scripting in my free time and have been trying to get better at actually posting the things that I make on Github. If you want to take a look, you can find that <a href="https://github.com/repkam09">here</a>.</p>

	<p>Other things about me, I played piano for over 13 years, I ran Track and Cross Country for 6 years, and my favorite TV show is Top Gear (followed closely by Doctor Who and Sherlock...)</p>

	<p>This server is hosted by <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>, who I highly recommend if you are looking for a Virtual Private Server!</p>

	</br>
	<p>If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="/contact">get in touch!</a></p>
